/*
 * The following lines are crucial to understanding how the ZUUIRevealController works.
 *
 * In this example, the FrontViewController is contained inside of a UINavigationController.
 * And the UINavigationController is contained inside of a ZUUIRevealController. Thus the
 * following hierarchy is created:
 *
 * - ZUUIRevealController is parent of:
 * - - UINavigationController is parent of:
 * - - - FrontViewController
 *
 * If you don't want the UINavigationController in between (which is totally fine) all you need to
 * do is to adjust the if-condition below in a way to suit your needs. If the hierarchy were to look 
 * like this:
 *
 * - ZUUIRevealController is parent of:
 * - - FrontViewController
 * 
 * Without a UINavigationController in between, you'd need to change:
 * self.navigationController.parentViewController TO: self.parentViewController
 *
 * Note that self.navigationController is equal to self.parentViewController. Thus you could generalize
 * the code even more by calling self.parentViewController.parentViewController. But in order to make 
 * the code easier to understand I decided to go with self.navigationController approach.
 *
